            As part of the Dublin High School Engineering and Design Academy, I have been introduced to careers and workplaces in the engineering field. I have learned a lot through field trips and numerous guest speakers. These experiences have helped me gain more insight into topics that I am already interested in or I want to explore more. <br /> <br />
            I was able to visit Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's National Ignition Facility. The National Ignition Facility is a large laser facility built to research fusion. Our tour guide was a computer scientist who worked at the facility. She provided us with more knowledge of how the facility utilizes computer science and computer scientists, which is the field that I am more interested in. This tour was also very engaging because it related to my interests in the future of energy and alternative energy. <br /> <br />
            Dr. Jason Yosinski was an influential guest speaker. He is a machine learning scientist and a founding member of Uber AI Labs. Dr. Yosinski talked to our class about machine learning and he demonstrated a couple of his projects, such as a deep visualization toolbox. I am very interested in machine learning and I had just started learning machine learning outside of class when Dr. Yosinski spoke in our class. Dr. Yosinski provided me with a deeper explanation of what neural networks are and how they work. While he was completing his Ph.D. at Cornell, Dr. Yosinski worked on a quadruped robot that learned to move. I really enjoyed learning about this project and this inspired me to want to learn more about artificial intelligence. <br /> <br />
