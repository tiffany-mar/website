                I want my career to be in the field of computer science. I plan 
                to learn some different coding languages to find one that I enjoy 
                and want to excel in. I find computer science a really fun and 
                interesting topic. I will enjoy continuing this in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started coding at the young age of six. I have used a couple of dif
                ferent coding languages. This experience has given me the ability to 
                be able to pick up newer languages easily. I mainly code in python. I
                have learnt Tkinter, GPIO, Pygame, and SQLite. I take classes to learn 
                programming. I can work independently and I do not rely on others.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I encounter a difficult project or assignment, I persevere and try 
                my hardest to get it done to the best of my ability, no matter how many 
                times I fail.  I took a particularly difficult class in 8th grade. At the 
                end of the year, I was recognized by my teacher in front of the school for
                having "grit". I am cooperative. During freshman year, I helped build the 
                float that helped us win first place. We all worked together and cooperated
                to come up with ideas and build the float.
            </p>
            <p>
              I try my best in all I do and never give up. I can work with others just 
              as well as I can work alone. Thank you for spending your time to read about 
              me. I invite you to look through my portfolio.
