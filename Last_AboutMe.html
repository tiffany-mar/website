                My name is Anika Sharma, a freshman at Dublin High School, and 
                welcome to my Online Portfolio. My personal career goal? I want 
                to be a software developer. When I learnt about software 
                development, I did not immediately know it was exactly what I 
                wanted to do with my life, but it always stuck with me. As I gained 
                more experience and explored my other interests, I realized I loved 
                the problem solving when debugging, the excitement of figuring 
                out how to code a new idea, and the satisfaction when everything 
                finally comes together. I am happily enrolled in the Engineering 
                Academy. To get paid to build apps and websites would be amazing. 
                To achieve this goal, I hope to gain more experience in other 
                languages and to continue to build programs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I started coding at a young age. When I first discovered 
                programming, I spent the whole day getting a turtle to make stars 
                and hearts through a series of commands in MIT Logo. Since then 
                I have learnt a couple different programming languages and I 
                continue to learn more in my Computer Science Principles class 
                this year. The computer I used back then was a Dell Inspiron 
                8600 2004 laptop clocking in at a "modest" 7.6 pounds. Technology 
                has been rapidly changing since then and it continues to do so. 
                My experience in different languages has given me the ability to 
                be able to pick up new languages easily. I am also a quick learner, 
                which allows me to learn new concepts, processes and ideas quickly. 
                This can help in the workplace when company uses a programming 
                language that I have not learnt yet or has a different way of doing things.

                Away from the computer screen, I was also involved in the school 
                musical, The Pajama Game. I was part of tech crew, and our job 
                was to make show come to life. My team and I would move set and 
                props of all sizes on and off stage. The experience helped me 
                learn how important communication is. During transitions, we would 
                often not be able to see each other and we were definitely not 
                allowed to speak. Therefore, as team, we would plan exactly who 
                turned how much and how many steps they would take. Another key 
                part of the job was staying organized. Throughout shows, tech crew 
                would need to manage where props where, how they were placed, and 
                making sure pathways were clear for set pieces and cast. I would 
                also need to be independent, as everyone was very busy and no one 
                would be able to help.
            </p>

                Last year, I took a difficult class. At the end of the year, I 
                was recognized by my teacher in front of the school. She said I 
                had grit. My experiences and interests lie in computing and working 
                with others to accomplish a goal, but most importantly, I will persevere.
