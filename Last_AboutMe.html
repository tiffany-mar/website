                My goal is to have a career in the field of computer science that 
                challenges me. I plan to gain experience in more computer programming 
                languages. I find computer science a really fun and interesting topic. 
                I will enjoy continuing this in the future.

                I started coding at a young age. I have used a couple of different 
                programming languages. This experience has given me the ability 
                to be able to pick up new languages easily. I mainly code in Python. 
            </p>

                I took a difficult class in 8th grade, Algebra 1. At the end of the 
                year, I was recognized by my teacher in front of the school for 
                having "grit". To have grit is to persevere or to be determined. 
                In my high school, we have a competition in which each grade must 
                come together to make a better float than the other grades. During 
                freshman year, I helped build the float that helped my class win 
                first place. We all worked together and cooperated to come up with 
                ideas and build the float.
            </p>
            <p>
              I try my best in all I do and never give up. I can work with others 
              just as well as I can work alone. Thank you for your time. 
              I invite you to look through my portfolio.
