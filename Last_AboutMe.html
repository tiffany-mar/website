                My goal is to have a career in the field of computer science 
                that challenges me to become more adaptable. I plan to gain experience in more computer 
                programming languages. I am looking to intern at various technology 
                companies and join the EnviroTech club. I find computer science a 
                really fun and interesting topic. I will enjoy continuing this in 
                the future.

                I started coding at a young age. I have used a couple of different 
                programming languages. I am currently taking Computer Science 
                Principles and I am learning and practicing new languages. This 
                experience has given me the ability to be able to pick up new 
                languages easily. I mainly code in Python.

                I took a difficult class in 8th grade, Algebra 1. At the end of 
                the year, I was recognized by my teacher in front of the school 
                for having "grit". To have grit is to persevere or to be determined. 
                In my high school, we have a competition in which each grade 
                must come together to make a better float than the other grades. 
                During freshman year, I helped build the float that helped my 
                class win first place. We all worked together and cooperated 
                to come up with ideas and build the float. I try my best in all 
                I do and never give up. I can work with others just as well as 
                I can work alone. Thank you for your time. I invite you to look 
                through my portfolio.
