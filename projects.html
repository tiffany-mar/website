                <h4>Survive The Forest</h4>
                <h6>August 2018-September 2018, Computer Science Principles</h6>
                <p>This purpose of this project was to create a game or storyline 
                with a great amount of user interaction. My partner and I decided 
                to make a storyline in which the user must try to survive in a forest. 
                The user are faced with different scenarios and they are given choices 
                to make. We worked side by side and discussed every part to make sure 
                it included both of our ideas. In this project, I cleaned up animations
                and programmed new scenes. My partner and I did encounter some challenges 
                with the animations messing up. We were able to pinpoint the problem 
                and find solutions. There was an instance where we wanted a 
                "sparks flying" effect, but it would die out after a mere couple 
                of seconds. I was able to figure out that there was a limit to the 
                amount of clones you could have, so I would kill a clone after its job 
                was done. This project helped me learn to think critically and problem 
                solve.</p>

                <h4>Oh My Spikes</h4>
                <h6>September 2018-October 2018, Computer Science Principles</h6>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to create an app. My partner and I 
                decided to make a game. In our game, a user controls the vertical movement 
                of a bird which consistently moves along the x-axis of the screen. The 
                goal is to reach the edge of a screen without crashing into spikes. We 
                split up how much and what parts we would program. It was my role to 
                organize the documentation. I helped make the spikes move and set new 
                y-positions for the spikes. My partner and I were having trouble making 
                our spikes move. We both proposed many different ways of solving the 
                problem and tested many variations of code. We finally found a way in 
                which make the spike "head" in a certain direction and add spikes to 
                all sides of the block.This project helped me learn the importance of 
                organization in code and ways to read and understand code.</p>
