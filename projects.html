                <h4>Survive The Forest</h4>
                <h5>Augest 2018-September 2018, Computer Science Principles</h5>
                <p>This purpose of this project was to create a game or storyline 
                with a great amount of user interaction. My partner and I decided 
                to make a storyline in which the user must try to survive in a forest. 
                The user are faced with different scenarios and they are given choices 
                to make. We worked side by side and discussed every part to make sure 
                it included both of our ideas. In this project, I cleaned up animations
                and programmed new scenes. We did encounter some challenges with the 
                animations messing up. We were able to pinpoint the problem and find 
                solutions. There was an instance where we wanted a "sparks flying" 
                effect, but it would die out after a mere couple of seconds. I was able 
                to figure out that there was a limit to the amount of clones you could 
                have, so I would kill a clone after its job was done.</p>

            <h4>Oh My Spikes</h4>
            <h5>September 2018-October 2018, Computer Science Principles</h5>
            <p>The purpose of this project was to create an app. My partner and I 
            decided to make a game. In our game, a user controls the vertical movement 
            of a bird which consistently moves along the x-axis of the screen. The 
            goal is to reach the edge of a screen without crashing into spikes. We 
            split up how much and what parts we would program. It was my role to 
            organize the documentation. I helped make the spikes move and set new 
            y-positions for the spikes. My partner and I were having trouble making 
            our spikes move. We both proposed many different ways of solving the 
            problem and tested many variations of code. We finally found a way in 
            which make the spike "head" in a certain direction and add spikes to 
            all sides of the block.</p>
