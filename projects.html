                <h4>Survive The Forest</h4>
                <h6>August 2018-September 2018, Computer Science Principles</h6>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to create a game or storyline with a great amount of user interaction. My partner and I decided to make a storyline in which the user must try to survive in a forest. The user is faced with different scenarios and they are given choices to make. We worked side by side and discussed every part to make sure it included both of our ideas. In this project, I cleaned up animations and programmed new scenes. My partner and I did encounter some challenges with the animations messing up. We were able to pinpoint the problem and find solutions. There was an instance where we wanted a "sparks flying" effect, but it would die out after a mere couple of seconds. I was able to figure out that there was a limit to the number of clones you could have, so I would kill a clone after its job was done. This project helped me learn to think critically and problem solve.</p>

                <h4>Oh My Spikes</h4>
                <h6>September 2018-October 2018, Computer Science Principles</h6>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to create an app. My partner and I decided to make a game. In our game, a user controls the vertical movement of a bird which consistently moves along the x-axis of the screen. The goal is to reach the edge of a screen without crashing into spikes. We split up how much and what parts we would program. It was my role to organize the documentation. I helped make the spikes move and set new y-positions for the spikes. My partner and I were having trouble making our spikes move. We both proposed many different ways of solving the problem and tested many variations of code. We finally found a way in which to make the spike "head" in a certain direction and add spikes to all sides of the block. This project helped me learn the importance of organization in code and ways to read and understand code.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this project was to create a software in which a client would be able to manipulate images using a series of effects whose values could be changed. My partner and I chose for our client to be a Phone Case Store that wanted a recognizable manipulation that could be applied to all their images. The client would add images to a folder, change the parameters of values to suit their likings, run our code which ask them manipulations they wanted to be applied on their images and would add the manipulated images to a different folder. My partner and I evenly split the programming and documentation. We worked together closely and helped each other work through bugs. My efforts were more focused on programming. I programmed the “triangle side”, “horizontal line”, and “drop shadow” effects and I helped my partner with the “logo” and “Triangles &amp; Rectangles” effects. I also worked on a feature that would allow multiple manipulations to be made to a singular image. This feature was harder to program. I tried many different approaches before I was finally able to find one that works. This project helped me improve my problem-solving skills and documentation skills.</p>

                <p>The purpose of this project was to work in a team to create a mechanical winch that could lift a 100-gram object up 30 cm. We also were required to present a simulation of our mechanical winch. My main role in this project was programming the NetLogo simulation, along with aiding my team in building the electrical and mechanical components. A challenge I faced in creating the NetLogo Simulation was to come up with a mathematical equation to adjust the placement of the gears and axles depending on the agents surrounding it. Through this project, I gained more experience with programming simulations and how to problem-solve.</p>

                <h4>Aerodynamic Design</h4>
                <h6>January 2020, Principles Of Engineering</h6>
                <p>The purpose of this project was to recommend a projectile design. Our client, Nitro Planes, was looking to produce toy projectiles and wanted far-flying design recommendations. Each person in my team made two designs, and we would choose one design for our whole team to recommend. My main role in this project was to create my two paper rockets and write a design evaluation for each. I also delegated tasks and ensured the whole team stayed on task. I named my first design Jimmy Turner. In 8th-grade history class, we had learned that groves that went around the inside of the barrel of a gun, like a candy cane, helped bullets fly straighter and farther. I used this knowledge when designing Jimmy Turner; Jimmy Turner’s fins were slanted slightly to ensure it spun in the air, like a bullet. I learned from this experience and from seeing other people’s designs. For my second projectile, which I named Bar Code, I used duct tape on the outside of the rocket to secure the cone and I swept the wings back. In this project, I went through the design process and I improved my documentation skills.</p>
