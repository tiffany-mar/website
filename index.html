                            Hello! My name is Anika Sharma, a senior at Dublin High School, and welcome to my online portfolio. My personal career goal? I want to be a software developer. When I learned about software development, I did not immediately know it was what I wanted to do with my life, but it always stuck with me. As I gained more experience and explored my other interests, I realized I love the problem solving when debugging, the excitement of figuring out how to program a new idea, and the satisfaction when everything finally comes together. I hope to gain more experience in other programming languages and to continue writing programs. Past high school, I plan to major in Computer Science at a four-year college.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I am continuing to dabble in various areas of computer science, from games in Pygame to photo recognition to web frameworks in Flask. I love to learn and I am very curious. I wrote my first program when I was 6; I spent the whole day getting a turtle to draw stars and hearts through a series of commands in MIT Logo. I am also a quick learner, which allows me to learn new concepts and process ideas quickly. I am currently enrolled in Dublin High Schoolâ€™s Engineering & Design Academy. This year, I am taking Digital Electronics. I am excited to learn about how computers actually work and how that can help me write more efficient code. Last year I took AP Computer Science Applications. I enjoyed challenging myself by learning a new coding language, Java. In tenth grade, I took Principles of Engineering. Through that class, I had the opportunity to learn about mechanical and electrical engineering. We had to troubleshoot often, as the first design would never work. I have become better at troubleshooting and problem solving, which is a skill I can carry with me through my professional career.
                        </p>

                            Along with programming, I am passionate about environmental justice and climate change. I am working to build up a policy-focused organization named California Youth 4 Climate. In this organization, my main responsibility is to keep us moving forward. I create agendas, lead calls, facilitate communication between teams, delegate tasks, and keep us motivated. In short, I am a leader. I listen to concerns and adapt plans to meet new challenges. One of my biggest beliefs as a leader is to recognize the work that people put in. Although I prefer to be a team player, I saw there was a need for someone to lead the organization and I stepped up to the responsibility. Previously, I was part of the Logistics Team for California Youth Climate Strike, where my main role was to aid chapters in planning actions. During Earth Week, I applied the CSS and HTML I had learned in school to make a form pop up on our website. I  also organized the first ever climate protest in Dublin, California. We planned the protest in only 10 days, so I learned the importance of time management and prioritization.

                            This is me, Anika Sharma, a student who is passionate about the environment and is excited to pursue a future in Computer Science. Thank you for your time and feel free to look through the rest of my portfolio.
