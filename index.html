                            Hello! My name is Anika Sharma, a junior at Dublin High School, and welcome to my online portfolio. My personal career goal? I want to be a software developer. When I learned about software development, I did not immediately know it was exactly what I wanted to do with my life, but it always stuck with me. As I gained more experience and explored my other interests, I realized I loved the problem solving when debugging, the excitement of figuring out how to code a new idea, and the satisfaction when everything finally comes together.In order to achieve this goal, I hope to gain more experience in other programming languages and to continue to build programs. Past high school, I plan to major in Computer Science at a four-year college. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started coding at a young age. When I first discovered programming, I spent the whole day getting a turtle to draw stars and hearts through a series of commands in MIT Logo. Since then I have learnt a couple different programming languages and I continue to learn more. The computer I used back then was a Dell Inspiron 8600 2004 laptop clocking in at a “modest” 7.6 pounds. Technology has been rapidly changing since then and it continues to do so. My experience in different languages has given me the ability to be able to pick up new languages easily. I am also a quick learner, which allows me to learn new concepts, processes and ideas quickly. This can help in the workplace when company uses a programming language that I have not learnt yet or has unfamiliar processes or protocols.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am currently enrolled in Dublin High School’s Engineering &amp; Design Academy, and I am proud to be in the academy. Through my coursework at school, I have learned a lot, and I continue to strive to learn more. Last year, I took the class Computer Science Principles. In this class, I had the opportunity to learn new programming languages and expand my knowledge on others. Currently, I am taking Principles of Engineering. Through this class, I have the opportunity to learn about mechanical and electrical engineering. In this class, we have to troubleshoot often. The first version of the mechanism will never work. I have grown in trouble-shooting and problem solving.  
                        </p>
